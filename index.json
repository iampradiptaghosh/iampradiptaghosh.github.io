We use a recently developed constrained optimization tool (Satisfiability Modulo Convex Optimization (SMC)) that has the expressivity needed for this problem.

Network Synthesis: The second part of the research focus on optimal usage of these public resources in smart city applications by forming an optimized network with them. For example, assume that we need an area to be monitored constantly during a search and rescue mission. In that case, we might have either a lot of unnecessary cameras or might have less than the required number of cameras already present. Building upon modern constrained optimization techniques, we are working on developing techniques that can subselect the optimal set of sensors as well as inform us if more sensors need to be deployed. If more sensors are required to be deployed, the method also outputs what are the best locations to place them.   Cross Camera Activity Detection: The third part of research focus on detecting complex activities in smart cities. A complex activity can be “a person getting off an car then smoking then talking to another person and walking together”. While a human can easily interpret these actions, for a machine it is very hard to automatically detect such activity. In addition, if these actions occur across multiple cameras i.e., some part of the activity in one camera and the other in a different camera, then it is even a tougher problem.

To address this challenge, we empirically study file transfer times between geographically dispersed cloud computing points using SCP (secure copy). We show, to our knowledge for the first time, that the end to end file transfer latency experienced by this widely-used protocol is better modelled to have a quadratic dependency on the file size (instead of a simple linear dependency that would be expected if the network were treated as an bit-pipe with a deterministic average bandwidth).

While striking, these guarantees are based on idealized assumptions (including global synchronization, centralized control, and infinite buffers) and heretofore have only been evaluated through simplified numerical simulations.

Multimodal optimization amounts to finding multiple global and local optima (as opposed to a single solution) of a function, so that the user can have a better knowledge about different optimal solutions in the search space. Niching algorithms have the ability to locate and maintain more than one solution to a multi-modal optimization problem. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has remained an attractive alternative for solving complex and difficult optimization problems since its advent in 1995. However, both experiments and analysis show that the basic PSO algorithms cannot identify different optima, either global or local, and thus are not appropriate for multimodal optimization problems that require the location of multiple optima. In this paper a niching algorithm named as Modified Local Neighborhood Based Niching Particle Swarm Optimization (ML-NichePSO)is proposed. The ability, efficiency and usefulness of the proposed method to identify multiple optima are demonstrated using well-known numerical benchmarks","tags":[],"title":"Modified local neighborhood based niching particle swarm optimization for multimodal function optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pradipta Ghosh","Swagatam Das"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593979426,"objectID":"fac00dd0ba7c8be43121e699ceb78357","permalink":"https://iampradiptaghosh.github.io/publication/ghosh-2011-synthesis/","publishdate":"2020-07-05T17:44:09.675941Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ghosh-2011-synthesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Circular antenna array design is one of the most important electromagnetic optimization problems of current interest. The problem of designing a large multiple concentric planar thinned circular ring arrays of uniformly excited isotropic antennas is considered inthis paper. This antenna must generate a pencil beam pattern in the vertical plane along with minimized side lobe level (SLL). In this paper, we present an optimization method based on an improved variant of one of the most powerful real parameter optimizers of current interest, called Differential Evolution (DE). Two sets of different cases have been studied here. First set deals with thinned array design with the goal to achieve number of switched off elements equal to 220 or more.The other set contains design of array while maintaining side lobe level (SLL) below a fixed value. Both set contains two types of design, one with uniform inter-element spacing fixed at 0.5λ and the other withoptimum uniform inter-element spacing. The half-power beam width of the synthesized pattern is attempted to maintain fixed at the value equal to that of a fully populated array with uniform spacing of 0.5λ. Simulation results of the designed thinned arrays are compared with a fully populated array for all the cases to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method","tags":[],"title":"Synthesis of thinned planar concentric circular antenna arrays---A differential evolutionary approach","type":"publication"}]
